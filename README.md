# cncu-01
Ethernet-CAN converter (Development board) based on STM32F407

This is open-source project that includes PCB-design files and part of firmware for CNCU-01 board.
PCB-design was developed using Altium Designer 17 and Firmware is based on LwIP stack and FreeRTOS was developed using 'C' with Keil uVision 5.
NOTE: Firmware is under development. Now it supports main board's modules features + web interface but no application logic.

CNCU-01 board supports:
- RS232 \ RS485
- Ethernet 10\100 Mb
- microSD
- CAN
- USB serial (COM)
- SPI
- I2C
- UART
- SW \ JTAG
- GPIO
